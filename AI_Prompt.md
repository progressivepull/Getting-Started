## Add Hyper Link to Markdown Document

The original link just points to the Lesson_2 folder. This works only if the folder has an index.md, README.md, or other logic to automatically load content. Otherwise, it leaves the user in a directory, not a specific lesson.

The updated linkdirectly links to the .md file you intended. It ensures consistency, reduces confusion, and matches user expectationsâ€”especially in documentation or learning modules where clarity matters.

```
Please change the Markdown link in the following line from linking to a directory to linking to a specific Markdown file.

Current line:
* [ 2.5 A high-level view of AWS services ](./Lesson_2/)

Desired change:
* [ 2.5 A high-level view of AWS services ](./Lesson_2/2.5_A_high-level_view_of_AWS_services.md)

Document to Change is as follows:
```

# Add Number to the Markdown Document

```
Please update the following Markdown list to add a numerical prefix (e.g., "4.1", "4.2") to each list item, corresponding to its position within "Lesson 4".

Current list items:
* [ Module 2: AWS foundational services introduction  ](./Lesson_4/)
* [ Learning objectives ](./Lesson_4/)

Desired change:
* [ 4.1 Module 2: AWS foundational services introduction  ](./Lesson_4/)
* [ 4.2 Learning objectives ](./Lesson_4/)

Document to Change is as follows:
